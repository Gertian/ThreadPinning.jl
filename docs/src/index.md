# ThreadPinning.jl

*Interactively pin Julia threads to specific cores at runtime*

## Why pin Julia threads?

Because
* [it effects performance (MFlops/s), in particular on HPC clusters with multiple NUMA domains](https://github.com/JuliaPerf/BandwidthBenchmark.jl#flopsscaling)
* [it allows you to measure hardware-performance counters in a reliable way](https://juliaperf.github.io/LIKWID.jl/stable/marker/)
* ...

## Installation

**Note: Only Linux is supported!** (macOS doesn't support thread pinning. Windows might or might not work.)

The package is registered. Hence, you can simply use
```
] add ThreadPinning
```
to add the package to your Julia environment.

## Explanation

We use libc's [sched_getcpu](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sched_getcpu.3.html) to query the CPU-core ID for a thread and libuv's [uv_thread_setaffinity](https://github.com/clibs/uv/blob/master/docs/src/threading.rst) to set the affinity of a thread.


## Noteworthy Alternatives

* Setting `JULIA_EXCLUSIVE=1` will make julia use compact pinning automatically (no external tool needed!)
* [`pinthread` / `pinthreads`](https://juliaperf.github.io/LIKWID.jl/dev/examples/dynamic_pinning/) or `likwid-pin` (CLI tool) from [LIKWID.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPerf/LIKWID.jl)
* [This discourse thread](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/thread-affinitization-pinning-julia-threads-to-cores/58069/5) discusses issues with alternatives like `numactl`
