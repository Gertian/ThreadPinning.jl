# ThreadPinning.jl

[ThreadPinning.jl](https://github.com/carstenbauer/ThreadPinning.jl/) allows you to pin Julia threads to specific CPU threads (i.e. "hardware threads" or, equivalently, "CPU processors") via functions, environment variables, or [Julia preferences](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Preferences.jl). Especially for applications running on HPC clusters, this is often absolutely crucial to achieve optimal performance and/or obtain reliable benchmarks (see [Why pin Julia threads?](@ref why)).

!!! note
    Be aware that Julia implements **task-based multithreading**: `M` user tasks get scheduled onto `N` Julia threads.
    While this package allows you to pin Julia threads to CPU threads,  it is generally not
    safe to assume that a computation (started with `Threads.@spawn` or `Threads.@threads`) will run on or even stay on a certain Julia thread (see [this discourse post](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/julia-1-7-says-it-can-switch-the-thread-your-task-is-on-how-often-does-that-happen-and-how-can-it-be-disabled/75373/4?u=carstenbauer) for more information). If you want this guarantee, you can use our [`@tspawnat`](@ref) macro instead.

## Installation

**Note: Only Linux is supported!**

The package is registered. Hence, you can simply use
```
] add ThreadPinning
```
to add the package to your Julia environment.

### Prerequisites


To gather information about the hardware topology of the system (e.g. sockets and memory domains), ThreadPinning.jl uses [`lscpu`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lscpu.1.html). The latter must therefore be available (i.e. be on `PATH`), which should automatically be the case on virtually all linux systems.

In the unlikely case that `lscpu` isn't already installed on your system, here are a few ways to get it
* install `util-linux` via your system's package manager or manually from [here](https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/)
* download the same as a Julia artifact: [util\_linux\_jll.jl](https://github.com/JuliaBinaryWrappers/util_linux_jll.jl)

## Noteworthy Alternatives

* Simply setting `JULIA_EXCLUSIVE=1` will pin Julia threads to CPU threads in "physical order" (i.e. as specified by `lscpu`), which might or might not include hyperthreads.
* [`pinthreads`](https://juliaperf.github.io/LIKWID.jl/dev/examples/dynamic_pinning/) or `likwid-pin` (CLI tool) from [LIKWID.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPerf/LIKWID.jl)
* [This discourse thread](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/thread-affinitization-pinning-julia-threads-to-cores/58069/5) discusses issues with alternatives like `numactl`
